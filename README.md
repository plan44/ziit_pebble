Ziit Pebble Watchface
=====================

Long before the Pebble, a friend suggested we need a Swiss German text clock, and we did that as a (free) iPhone app. Now it was clearly ziit (time) to bring this minimalistic watch face to the pebble.

Ziit Pebble Watchface is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE.txt).

The only requirement of this license is that you *must include the copyright
and the license text* when you distribute apps based on this code.

I'd be happy about contributions of other Swiss German dialect time texts (or international ones, for that matter). I might not only build pebble watch faces, but also add them into the iOS app in a future release.

**Important**: This code is based on Pebble's early beta or even alpha proof-of-concept SDK, so it is highly probable this code will break and need adaption in the near future as Pebble SDK matures. **Use entirely on you own risk**.

To install and use the pebble SDK, please follow the instructions at [developer.getpebble.com/2](https://developer.getpebble.com/2/).

To download the compiled watchface (.pbw file) or the original iOS app, please see the [Ziit page here](http://www.mixwerk.ch/ziit_app.php)
